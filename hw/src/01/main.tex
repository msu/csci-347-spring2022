\section*{Problem 1 (2 points)}

What are the two main types of attributes typically found in data?

\section*{Problem 2 (14 points)}

Consider the following data matrix

$$
    D = \begin{matrix}
            & X_1   & X_2   & X_3 \\
        x_1 &  0.3  & 23    & 5.6 \\
        x_2 &  0.4  &  1    & 5.2 \\
        x_3 &  1.8  &  4    & 5.2 \\
        x_4 &  6.0  & 50    & 5.1 \\
        x_5 & -0.5  & 34    & 5.7 \\
        x_6 &  0.4  & 19    & 5.4 \\
        x_7 &  1.1  & 11    & 5.5 \\
    \end{matrix}
$$

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (2 points) What is the estimated mean of $X_3$?
    \item (2 points) What is the estimated covariance between $X_1$ and $X_3$?
    \item (2 points) What is the estimated multi-dimensional mean of $D$?
    \item (2 points) What is the estimated variance of $X_2$?
    \item (2 points) What is the covariance matrix of $D$?
    \item (2 points) What is the estimated correlation between $X_1$ and $X_3$?
    \item (2 points) What is the total variance $D$?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 3 (6 points)}

Given $a, b \in \R^4$ (that is a fancy way of saying that $a$ and $b$ are
4-dimensional vectors with real values) where
\begin{eqnarray*}
    a &=& \begin{bmatrix} 2.0  & 5.0 & -2.6 & 6.0 \end{bmatrix} \\
    b &=& \begin{bmatrix} 15.0 & 2.5 &  4.0 & 4.0 \end{bmatrix}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (2 points) What is $\|a-b\|_2$?
    \item (2 points) What is $\|a-b\|_1$?
    \item (2 points) What is the cosine of the angle between $a$ and $b$?
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Problem 4 (3 points)}

The following questions reference the Heart Disease data set from the UCI
Machine Learning Repository:

\url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (1 point) One attribute is named ``cigs''.  What information is stored
    in the ``cigs'' attribute?
    \item (1 point) How man rows (i.e., observations, entities, instances) are
    there in the data set?
    \item (1 point) How man attributes are there in the data set?
\end{enumerate}
